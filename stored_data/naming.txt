The order of the naming goes: "diff" if difference between two variables, then characteristic of the variable, e.g. "opt" or "T50", then time period, e.g. "tot" or "future_rcp45". In the case of "diff" the variable and two period are used, where the result is is period_1 period_2. char_ec.csv are the characteristic variables according to the standard for the municipal centers. The only files not produced within the program is EN1991.csv, which contains the factors from NS-EN 1991-1-3 NA used in this program, and swe_Gloshaugen.csv which is used for the timeseries/percentile plot. For the former it is stressed that the factors are meant as documentation for this program and should not be used for other purposes.
